This is a simple project of understanding responsiveness and java script.

In this Project, I have created a simple NavBar and some divs of components in navbar. Whenever the user scroll the page, the link respective to the div will activate or highlight in navbar. And the user can also click on the link on navbar and scroll to the respective div.

There was responsive in the website.

When the screen size of user is large like of laptops and desktops the horizantal navbar appears.

If the screen size of user is small like of mobiles and tablets the Hamburger Icon appears and by clicking on it the user gets vertical navbar.
